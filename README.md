# OpenDCDiag

OpenDCDiag is an open-source project designed to identify defects and
bugs in CPUs. It consists of a set of tests built around a
sophisticated CPU testing framework. OpenDCDiag is primarily intended
for, but not limited to, Data Center CPUs.

## License

OpenDCDiag is released under the [Apache 2.0](LICENSE) license. The
OpenDCDiag framework includes some source code from other projects,
released under different licenses.  See

## Building OpenDCDiag

### Prerequisites

#### Ubuntu

OpenDCDiag has been built and tested on Ubuntu 21.04 and 21.10.
Before building, the following prerequisites must be installed.

```console
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ cmake libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev libzstd-dev zlib1g-dev libgtest-dev meson
```

#### Fedora

OpenDCDiag has been built and tested on Fedora 33 and 34.
Before building, the following prerequisites must be installed.

```console
sudo dnf install -y boost-devel eigen3-devel gcc gcc-c++ git gtest-devel meson zlib-devel libzstd-devel
```

#### Optional Prerequisites

##### Openssl

OpenDCDiag has been built and tested using Openssl 1.1.X and 3.0.
Before building and in order to enable extra Openssl content,
the following prerequisite must be installed:

```console
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

```console
# Fedora:
sudo dnf install -y openssl-devel
```

Before building, it is also needed to configure project using following option:

```console
meson builddir --buildtype=release -Dssl_link_type=dynamic
```

### Building

OpenDCDiag is built with the [Meson Build
System](https://mesonbuild.com/). For example, a release build can be
easily created as follows.

```console
meson builddir --buildtype=release
ninja -C builddir
```

## Writing Tests

The OpenDCDiag framework is designed to make the creation of new CPU
tests as simple as possible. It takes care of much of the boiler
plate code CPU tests need, e.g., test life cycle, threading model, CPU
feature identification, random number generation, etc. This allows test
authors to concentrate on the specific test functionality that
interests them. A detailed guide to writing new OpenDCDiag tests is
presented in [A Guide to Writing OpenDCDiag
tests](docs/writing_tests.md).

## Intel速 Data Center Diagnostic Tool

Intel provides a tool called the
[Intel速 Data Center Diagnostic Tool](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000058107/processors/intel-xeon-processors.html)
for verifying the functionality of all cores within an Intel速 Xeon速
processor.  Intel Data Center Diagnostic Tool is built using the OpenDCDiag framework and is
freely downloadable.  It is not however open-source and it is designed for
use with Intel Xeon processors only. The Intel Data Center
Diagnostic Tool contains additional tests that are not part of the OpenDCDiag project.
